# Phosani's Nightmare - Enrage Phase Removal

## Changes Made

### Code Updates

#### PhosaniHandler.java
1. **Removed Constants**:
   - `ENRAGE_ATTACK_CYCLE_TICKS = 4` (no longer needed)
   - Updated comment: `ATTACK_CYCLE_TICKS = 6; // Consistent 6-tick cycle throughout fight`

2. **Removed Fields**:
   - `Map<Integer, Integer> phosaniHpPercentages` (HP tracking no longer needed)

3. **Updated Methods**:
   - `getAttackCycleTicks()`: Now always returns `ATTACK_CYCLE_TICKS` (6 ticks)
   - `isPhosaniInEnragePhase()`: Now always returns `false` with explanatory comment
   - `onGameTick()`: Removed HP percentage tracking logic
   - `reset()`: Removed HP percentages clearing

4. **Updated Logging**:
   - Removed "[ENRAGE PHASE]" indicators from all log messages
   - Simplified attack detection and timer initialization logs

### Documentation Updates

#### PHOSANI_INTEGRATION.md
- **Attack Timer**: Updated to reflect consistent 6-tick cycle
- **Attack Timing**: Removed enrage phase references
- **Technical Notes**: Removed HP ratio monitoring

#### README.md
- **Phosani Section**: Removed enrage detection and timing references
- **Simplified Description**: Focus on consistent attack timing

#### IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
- **Features**: Updated to reflect consistent 6-tick cycle

## Technical Impact

### Simplified Logic
- **No HP Monitoring**: Eliminates unnecessary health ratio calculations
- **Consistent Timing**: Single attack speed throughout entire fight
- **Reduced Complexity**: Fewer conditional checks and branches

### Performance Benefits
- **Less Processing**: No HP percentage calculations each tick
- **Simpler State Management**: Fewer variables to track and clear
- **Cleaner Logs**: Reduced log spam from HP tracking

### User Experience
- **Predictable Timing**: Players can rely on consistent 6-tick rhythm
- **Simplified Learning**: No need to account for phase transitions
- **Reliable Overlay**: Timer behavior is constant throughout fight

## Current Behavior

### Attack Timing
- **Consistent 6 Ticks**: Throughout entire Phosani encounter
- **No Variations**: Timing never changes regardless of boss HP
- **Reliable Predictions**: Players can count on steady rhythm

### Curse Mechanics (Unchanged)
- **Curse Detection**: Still tracks animation 8599
- **Prayer Shuffling**: Still handles 5-attack curse duration
- **Smart Overlay**: Still shows correct prayer to click during curse

### Visual Indicators
- **Attack Timer**: Shows countdown from 6 to 1
- **Phase Colors**: Still indicate attack types (with curse awareness)
- **Curse Counter**: Still displays remaining curse attacks

## Verification Checklist

✅ **Code Compilation**: Successful build with no errors  
✅ **Timer Logic**: Always uses 6-tick cycle  
✅ **HP Tracking**: Completely removed  
✅ **Log Messages**: No enrage phase references  
✅ **Documentation**: Updated consistently across all files  
✅ **Curse Functionality**: Preserved and working  

## Final State

The Phosani's Nightmare implementation now correctly reflects the actual boss mechanics:
- **Single Attack Speed**: 6 ticks throughout entire fight
- **No Enrage Phase**: Consistent behavior regardless of HP
- **Full Curse Support**: Intelligent prayer shuffling assistance
- **Clean Implementation**: Simplified code with better performance

The plugin is ready for testing with accurate Phosani's Nightmare mechanics!
